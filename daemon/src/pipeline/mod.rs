//! The end-to-end input streaming pipeline (`daemon/todos.json` G8):
//! capture (E1) -> switch-aware gate (only while this device is
//! `Active`, per F2/F3's local switch state) -> `Channel::send` on the
//! sending side; `Channel::recv` -> injector (E2) on the receiving
//! side. Coded entirely against `flow_core::channel::Channel` and
//! `flow_core::input::{InputCapture, InputInjector}` — never a concrete
//! medium or platform type — so the gating logic here is exactly what
//! this module's own tests exercise without real hardware or a real
//! network (a real, loopback-connected `TcpChannel` stands in for "any
//! `Channel`", the same substitution `channel::negotiate`/`::handshake`'s
//! own tests already make).
//!
//! `vision.md`'s North Star ("just press a key and continue working")
//! is this pipeline: it's the first place capture, a `Channel`, and
//! injection are wired into one continuous loop.
